# preproccessing
This repository is dedicated to the preproccessing of the data contained in the stock exchange source files. The files were modified by adding columns like:
* SMA(15)
* SMA(45)
* RSI(14)  

It can be useful for sb who would like to utilize these information for machine learning with RNN
